    <img src="image-2.jpg" alt="Fashon Image 2">
    <p><a href="#">NYFW</a> can be both amazingly fun & incredibly overwhelming, especially if you've never been. Luckily, I'm here to give you an insider's guide and make your
        first show a pleasurable experience. By taking my tips and tricks, and following your gut, you'll have an unforgettable experience!</p>
    <h2>Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows</h2>

    <p>If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn't so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I'm here to help you out. First,
        plan out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you're worrying about blowing your cash the
        whole time you won't have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and
        get excited!</p>
    <h2>Dressing for The Shows</h2>

    <p>Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don't youll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing
        yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines. Also it's important to wear shoes youll be comfortable in all day.
        Obviously you want to look good, but you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
